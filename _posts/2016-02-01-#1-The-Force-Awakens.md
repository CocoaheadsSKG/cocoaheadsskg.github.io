#### Description
Happy New Year everyone!

There is a disturbance in the Force coming from a forgotten region of the Galaxy; the small city of Thessaloniki. After the long and mysterious disappearance of all the iOS and MacOS developers, a small delegation of a newly founded group, known as The New Rebellion, will be dispatched to investigate the matter and hopefully restore the injustice.

Your presence is considered of outmost importance.
