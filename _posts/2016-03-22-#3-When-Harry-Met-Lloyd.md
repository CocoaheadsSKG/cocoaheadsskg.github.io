#### Description
Holla everyone! As it seems, there is now an 4inch iPhone which is a fast as the iPhone 6S! There is also a new iPad Pro which is not the iPad Pro because it's smaller! Also iOS, OSX and XCode got updated and Swift dropped `++` and `--`
operators! Crazy times we live in, don't you think? I guess it's also time for our third meetup to discuss all the newly released products and some of the technical stuff outlined above.

Harry: *There's a new meetup? Why didn't you tell me?*
<br>Lloyd: *Three words: I did.*

See you all there!
