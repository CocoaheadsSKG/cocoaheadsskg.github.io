#### Description
The city's tech scene is dancing to the [DEVit](http://devitconf.org) rhythm. But that doesn't mean we won't have CocoaHeads SKG meetup
for you in time! In fact we do! And it's going to be a blast with a fresh new entry speaking about tvOS and a very
interesting talk for creating Today Widgets. Hear us on this one, you don't want to miss this. Feel free to bring a friend or two with
you too.

See you there!
