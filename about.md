### Can I contribute?

Hell yeah you can contribute. Here are some ways in order of importance:

* **Make a presentation**. Everyone is welcome to present his project/library/framework or other related topic he finds interesting.
* **Spread the love**. Share upcoming events on social media. Bring people you know with you. We love meeting new fellas!
* **Take photos**. Most of us are camera shy but that's always bound to change. It'd be nice to have an archive of all the great times he had together!
* **Update the website**. Found something's missing? Your OCD urges you to fix a margin? Check [our organization on GitHub](https://github.com/CocoaheadsSKG)
